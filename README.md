# CrystalCave
This game was developed for study purpose, over the course [Unreal Engine Blueprint Developer: Learn Visual Scripting](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealblueprint/)
The game has two levels, where the player(Sphere) needs to go from point A to point B and capture all crystals. If you have any question, please, let me know.

## Why did I do that?
For a consistent knowledge.
